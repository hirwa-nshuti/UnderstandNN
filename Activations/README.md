* ### Sigmoid activation function

The sigmoid function is a mathematics function having a characteristic "S"-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. as writen here
[Sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)

Sometimes referred to as a logistic function it is also a non-linear function used in Deep Learning and Logistic regression

$S(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

Some constraints for sigmoid if the value of x is large positive number the function gives number close to 1
and if x is a negative large number the function results into a number close to 0.
