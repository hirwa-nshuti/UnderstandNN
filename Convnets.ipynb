CNNs are particularly most useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, faces, and scenes. And they can also be quite effective when used for classifying non-image data such as audio, time series etc.\n","\n","Refering to perceptrons the CNNs are regularized multilayer perceptrons. The regularization is to prevent them from proning to overrfitting on the training Data. And we can say that it is a feedforward neural network with input layer, hidden layer and output layer. And in the hidden layer the inputs are masked by activation function and later the **[ Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution)** operation.\n","\n","*The three main layers of a CNN are Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and Fully-Connected Layer.
